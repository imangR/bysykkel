\description{
\code{fread_trips_data} imports anonymized
historical bike trip records in Norway for the city of Oslo, Bergen,
and Trondheim directly into R.

Reading the trip records CSV files from the City Bike websites can
take its time using \code{read_trips_data}. To speed up the process,
\code{fread_trips_data} utilizes the \code{fread} function in the
\code{data.table} packages. To use \code{fread_trips_data} requires
having \code{data.table} installed.

To get trip records for winter bikes in each city, add a capital "W" at
the end of the city name (f.ex. "OsloW" for Oslo). Trip records for winter
bikes are currently available for Oslo only at the time of writing
(2019-03-04).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read bike trips data for the month of January 2019 in Bergen
bergen_trips <- fread_trips_data(2019, 1, "Bergen")

# Read bike trips data for the month of October 2018 in Trondheim
trondheim_trips <- fread_trips_data(2018, 10, "Trondheim")

# Use "lapply" to read bike trips data for several months in Oslo
oslo_winter_trips <- lapply(01:02, fread_trips_data, year = 2019, city = "OsloW")
}
